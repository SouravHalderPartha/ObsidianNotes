Angular CLI  ( command line interface for Angular ).

Project folder contains the package.json file.

rxjs works with data.

npm install ( installs the packages defined in package.json file)

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
**peerDependencies**: A peer dependency is a _specific version or set of versions_ of a third-party software library that _a module is designed to work with_. They're similar in concept to the relationship between a browser extension and a browser. (Example: [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) has two quite logical peerDependencies: `react` and `redux`.)

npm install -g @angular/cli  ( installs angular globally)

ng new yourAppName (creates a new angular app)
